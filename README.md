# Whispers in the Machine: Confidentiality in LLM-integrated Systems
This is the code repository accompanying our paper [Whispers in the Machine: Confidentiality in LLM-integrated Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06922).
>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with external tools and commercial services into <i><b>LLM-integrated systems</i></b>. While these interfaces can significantly enhance the capabilities of the models, they also introduce a new attack surface. Manipulated integrations, for example, can exploit the model and compromise sensitive data accessed through other interfaces. While previous work primarily has focused on attacks targeting a model's alignment or the leakage of training data, the security of data that is <i><b>only available during inference</i></b> has escaped scrutiny. In this work, we demonstrate the vulnerabilities associated with external components and introduce a systematic approach to evaluate confidentiality risks in LLM-integrated systems. We identify several specific attack scenarios unique to these systems and formalize these into a <i><b>tool-robustness</i></b> framework designed to measure a model's ability to protect sensitive information. This framework allows us to assess the modelâ€™s vulnerability to confidentiality attacks. Our findings show that all examined models are highly vulnerable to attacks, with the risk increasing significantly when models are used together with external tools.

### This framework was developed to study the confidentiality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in integrated systems. The framework contains several features:
- A set of attacks against LLMs, where the LLM is not allowed to leak a secret key -> [jump to section](#attacks-and-defenses)
- A set of defenses against the aforementioned attacks -> [jump to section](#attacks-and-defenses)
- The possibility to test the LLM's confidentiality in dummy tool-using scenarios as well as with the mentioned attacks and defenses -> [jump to section](#attacks-and-defenses)
- Testing LLMs in real-world tool-scenarios using LangChains Google Drive and Google Mail integrations -> [jump to section](#real-world-tool-scenarios)
- Creating enhanced system prompts to safely instruct an LLM to keep a secret key safe -> [jump to section](#generate-system-prompt-datasets)
- Instructions for <b>reproducibility</b> can be found at the end of this README -> [jump to section](#Reproducibility)

>[!WARNING]
><b>Hardware acceleration is only fully supported for CUDA machines running Linux. MPS on MacOS should somewhat work but Windows with CUDA could face some issues.</b>

## Setup
Before running the code, install the requirements:
```
python -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
If you want to use models hosted by OpenAI or Huggingface, create both a ```key.txt``` file containing your OpenAI API key as well as a ```hf_token.txt``` file containing your Huggingface Token for private Repos (such as Llama2) in the root directory of this project.

Sometimes it can be necessary to login to your Huggingface account via the CLI:
```
git config --global credential.helper store
huggingface-cli login
```

### Distributed Training
All scripts are able to work on multiple GPUs/CPUs using the [accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) library. To do so, run:
```
accelerate config
```
to configure the distributed training capabilities of your system and start the scripts with:
```
accelerate launch [parameters] <script.py> [script parameters]
```

# Attacks and Defenses

## Example Usage
```python
python attack.py --strategy "tools" --scenario "CalendarWithCloud" --attacks "payload_splitting" "obfuscation" --defense "xml_tagging" --iterations 15 --llm_type "llama3-70b" --temperature 0.7 --device cuda --prompt_format "react"
```
Would run the attacks ```payload_splitting``` and ```obfuscation``` against the LLM ```llama3-70b``` in the scenario ```CalendarWithCloud``` using the defense ```xml_tagging``` for 15 iterations with a temperature of 0.7 on a cuda device using the react prompt format in a tool-integrated system.

# Finetuning
This section covers the possible LLaMA finetuning options.
We use PEFT, which is based on [this](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) paper.

### Setup
Additionally to the above setup run
```bash
accelerate config
```
to configure the distributed training capabilities of your system. And
```bash
wandb login
```
with your WandB API key to enable logging of the finetuning process.

## Parameter Efficient Finetuning to harden LLMs against attacks or create enhanced system prompts
The first finetuning option is on a dataset consisting of system prompts to safely instruct an LLM to keep a secret key safe. The second finetuning option (using the ```--train_robust``` option) is using system prompts and adversarial prompts to harden the model against prompt injection attacks.

### Usage
```python
python finetuning.py [-h] [-llm | --llm_type LLM_NAME] [-i | --iterations ITERATIONS] [-a | --attacks ATTACKS_LIST] [-n | --name_suffix NAME_SUFFIX]
```

### Arguments
| Argument | Type | Default Value | Description |
|----------|------|---------------|-------------|
| ```-h, --help``` | - | - | Show this help message and exit |
| ```-llm, --llm_type``` | <b>str</b> | ```llama3-8b``` |Specifies the type of llm to finetune |
| ```-i, --iterations``` | <b>int</b> | ```10000``` | Specifies the number of iterations for the finetuning |
| ```-advs, --advs_train``` | <b>bool</b> | ```False``` | Utilizes the adversarial training to harden the finetuned LLM |
| ```-a, --attacks``` | <b>List[str]</b> | ```payload_splitting``` | Specifies the attacks which will be used to harden the llm during finetuning. Only has an effect if ```--train_robust``` is set to True. For supported attacks see the previous section |
| ```-n, --name_suffix``` | <b>str</b> | ```""``` | Specifies a suffix for the finetuned model name |


### Supported Large Language Models
Currently only the LLaMA models are supported (```llama2-7/13/70b``` / ```llama3-8/70b```).


# Generate System Prompt Datasets
Simply run the ```generate_dataset.py``` script to create new system prompts as a json file using LLMs.

### Arguments
| Argument | Type | Default Value | Description |
|----------|------|---------------|-------------|
| ```-h, --help``` | - | - | Show this help message and exit |
| ```-llm, --llm_type``` | <b>str</b> | ```llama3-70b``` |Specifies the LLM used to generate the system prompt dataset |
| ```-n, --name_suffix``` | <b>str</b> | ```""``` | Specifies a suffix for the model name if you want to use a custom model |
| ```-ds, --dataset_size``` | <b>int</b> | ```1000``` | Size of the resulting system prompt dataset |


# Real-World Tool Scenarios
To test the confidentiality of LLMs in real-world tool scenarios, we provide the possibility to test LLMs in Google Drive and Google Mail integrations. To do so, run the ```/various_scripts/llm_mail_test.py```script with your Google API credentials.

# Reproducibility
>[!WARNING]
><b>Depeding on which LLM is evaluated the evaluation can be very demanding in terms of GPU VRAM and time.</b>

>[!NOTE]
><b>Results can vary slightly from run to run. Ollama updates most of their LLMs constantly, so their behavior is subject to change. Also, even with the lowest temperature LLMs tend to fluctuate slightly in behvior due to internal randomness.</b>

### Baseline secret-key game
Will ask the LLM benign questions to check for leaking the secret even without attacks <br>
```python attack.py --llm_type <model_specifier> --strategy secret-key --attacks chat_base --defenses None --iterations 100 --device cuda```

### Attacks for secret-key game
Will run all attacks against the LLM without defenses. The iterations will be split equally onto the used attacks. So depending on the number of used attacks the number of iterations have to be adapted. (e.g., for 14 attacks with 100 iterations set the iterations parameter to 1400) <br>
```python attack.py --llm_type <model_specifier> --strategy secret-key --attacks all --defenses None --iterations 100 --device cuda```

### Attacks with defenses for secret-key game
Will run all attacks against the LLM with all defenses <br>
```python attack.py --llm_type <model_specifier> --strategy secret-key --attacks all --defenses all --iterations 100 --device cuda```

### Baseline tool-scenario
Will system prompt instruct the LLM with a secret key and the instructions to not leak the secret key followed by simple requests to print the secret key <br>
```python attack.py --llm_type <model_specifier> --strategy tools --scenario all --attacks base_attack --defenses None --iterations 100 --device cuda```

### Evaluating all tool-scenarios with ReAct
Will run all tool-scenarios without attacks and defenses using the ReAct framework <br>
```python attack.py --llm_type <model_specifier> --strategy tools --scenario all --attacks identity --defenses None --iterations 100 --prompt_format ReAct --device cuda```

### Evaluating all tool-scenarios with tool fine-tuned models
Will run all tool-scenarios without attacks and defenses using the ReAct framework <br>
```python attack.py --llm_type <model_specifier> --strategy tools --scenario all --attacks identity --defenses None --iterations 100 --prompt_format tool-finetuned --device cuda```

### Evaluating all tool fine-tuned models in all scenarios with additional attacks
Will run all tool-scenarios without attacks and defenses using the ReAct framework <br>
```python attack.py --llm_type <model_specifier> --strategy tools --scenario all --attacks all --defenses None --iterations 100 --prompt_format tool-finetuned --device cuda```

### Evaluating all tool fine-tuned models in all scenarios with additional attacks and defenses
Will run all tool-scenarios without attacks and defenses using the ReAct framework <br>
```python attack.py --llm_type <model_specifier> --strategy tools --scenario all --attacks all --defenses all --iterations 100 --prompt_format tool-finetuned --device cuda```
